# Online retail site
This is a project made during WWW Applications classes at the university. I used HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript and an SQL database to make the site look good. It is an example site, not suitable to use in a real business.

## Features
+ Viewing database content including images, text and links
+ Adding content to database
+ Uploading images
+ Accessibility features such as dark and bright modes, changing text size, toggling images
+ Javascript clock to make sure you don't spend too much time exploring the website!
+ Google map showing the location of my university

### Prerequisities
In the prerequisities folder, there is an SQL file that is required to be imported to the database in order to make the site work correctly. It is possible to change the name of the database, to do that, you need to alter it in the BazaTemp1.sql (prerequisities folder) file and in login.php (main folder).
